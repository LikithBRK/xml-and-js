Hello,
This is Likith.

As part of our group project, I have contributed an XML Schema Definition or XSD that defines the structure and rules for an XML document and I was also responsible for creating an XSL stylesheet that would transform the XML data into a well-formatted HTML table.

In the XSD part,
We have defined the root element as "software" with a type of "softwareType". This element contains a sequence of elements, the first of which is "JSON_ARRAY", with a type of "JSON_ARRAYType". The "JSON_ARRAYType" element contains several other elements such as "cName", "stockSymbol", "domain", "apps", and "employees".

The "apps" element has a type of "appsType" which contains another element "app" with a type of "appType". Similarly, the "employees" element has a type of "employeesType" which contains another element "employee" with a type of "employeeType". Finally, the "employeeType" element contains several sub-elements such as "eID", "fName", "lName", "email", "userName", "occupation", "department", and "device".

The "device" element has a type of "deviceType" which contains two sub-elements "ip" and "mac". All of these elements have been defined with their corresponding data types such as "xs:string" for strings.

Overall, this XSD ensures that our project has a well-defined structure for the XML data we are working with, and it will help us maintain consistency and clarity throughout the project. Thank you for listening, and I look forward to working together on this project.

Coming to the XSL part,
I started the stylesheet by creating a template that would match the root element of the XML document. Within this template, I created an HTML table with a header that included the table's title and column names. 
The body of the table was populated with the data from the XML document.

I then used the for-each loop to iterate over the JSON_ARRAY element, which contained information about each company. 
Within this loop, I created a row for each company and added the relevant data to each column, including the name of the company, its stock symbol, domain, employee details, and applications.
The employee details were particularly important, as they contained a lot of useful information that helped to make our table comprehensive and informative. I used an ordered list to list the details of each employee, including their ID, first name, last name, email, username, occupation, and department. I also added another ordered list for the details of each application.

Thank you,
