Hello! 
This is B.Ramakrishna Likith.

My Contribution for this project is majorly on HTML and CSS. 
HTML and CSS are crucial for this webpage as they define its structure, content, and style. HTML provides the basic structure and content of the webpage, including the header, main section, form, collection, and footer.

The HTML code defines our webpage with a title "LogoBoutiqueüè™". The webpage contains a header, a main section with a form to search for logos and a collection section, and a footer with copyright information. The form includes a text input field, a checkbox, and two buttons to apply filters and reload the page.

CSS styles the HTML elements, defining their colors, fonts, sizes, layout, and other visual aspects.The CSS code sets styles for a webpage.A form with labels, text inputs, checkboxes, and a submit button. The footer is fixed to the bottom of the page.

Without HTML, there would be no content or structure for the webpage, and without CSS, the webpage would lack visual appeal and user interface design.
